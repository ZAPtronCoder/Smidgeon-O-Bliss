-> Here are a list of ideas for this mod, base content wise:

> Vanilla stuff:
1. Mayo: made with 3 eggs with shapeless crafting. Provides 4 hunger and and 1 saturation.

> Create stuff:
1. Compat with Malum that allows you to drain the saps and syrups in a drain. The sap can be cooked by a mixer and heated basin to become sap, then can be reinserted into the bottle.
2. Follow up to #1, ability to put syrup on bread (any type) to make (Holy/Unholy) Sticky Buns.
