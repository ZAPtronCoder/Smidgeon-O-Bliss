-> Items and whatnot.

> Vanilla Stuff:
1. Obsidian bricks, pretty self-explanatory.
2. Plates, forks, spoons. (I’ll explain the function of them later)
3. Pantry. It would be able to store a large amount of food items and foodstuffs.
4. ‘Special Lute’; a minor little instrument that is pretty fun! Made from basic materials (‘#forge:string’, ‘#forge:planks’, ‘Iron Nuggets’). Akin to the ‘Flute’ from Supplementaries. Would give nearby pets the ‘Strength’ buff. It is a lute.
